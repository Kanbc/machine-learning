    "## Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "To attempt classification, one method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than 0.5 as a 0. However, this method doesn't work well because classification is not actually a linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification problem is just like the regression problem, except that the values we now want to predict take on only a small number of discrete values. For now, we will focus on the **binary classification problem** in which $y$ can take on only two values, $0$ and $1$. (Most of what we say here will also generalize to the multiple-class case.) \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then $x(i)$ may be some features of a piece of email, and $y$ may be $1$ if it is a piece of spam mail, and $0$ otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $y\\in\\{0,1\\}$. **$0$ is also called the negative class**, and **$1$ the positive class**, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols **“-” and “+.”** Given $x(i)$, the corresponding $y(i)$ is also called the label for the training example."

    "However, it is easy to construct examples where this method performs very poorly. Intuitively, it also doesn’t make sense for $h_{\\theta}(x)$ to take values larger than 1 or smaller than 0 when we know that $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, let’s change the form for our hypotheses $h_{\\theta}(x)$ to satisfy $0 ≤ h_{\\theta}(x) ≤ 1$. This is accomplished by plugging $\\theta^{T}x$ into the Logistic Function.\n",
