    "To establish notation for future use, we’ll use $x^{(i)}$ to denote the “input” variables (living area in this example), also called input features, and $y^{(i)}$ to denote the “output” or target variable that we are trying to predict (price). \n",
    "\n",
    "A pair ($x^{(i)},y^{(i)}$) is called a training example, and the dataset that we’ll be using to learn—a list of m training examples ($x^{(i)},y^{(i)}$); i=1,...,m — is called a training set. Note that the superscript “$(i)$” in the notation is simply an index into the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation. We will also use $X$ to denote the space of input values, and $Y$ to denote the space of output values. In this example, $X = Y = ℝ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function $h : X → Y$ so that $h(x)$ is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of $y$. For historical reasons, this function $h$ is called a hypothesis.\n",

When $y$ can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem."

    "\n",
    "This function is otherwise called the \"Squared error function\", or \"Mean squared error\". The mean is halved ($\\frac{1}{2}$) as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the $\\frac{1}{2}$ term.

    "Our objective is to get the best possible line. The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least. Ideally, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set. In such a case, the value of $J(\\theta_{0},\\theta_{1})$ will be 0. The following example shows the ideal situation where we have a cost function of 0.\n",

    "When $\\theta_{1} = 1$, we get a slope of 1 which goes through every single data point in our model. Conversely, when $\\theta_{1} = 0.5$, we see the vertical distance from our fit to the data points increase.\n",
