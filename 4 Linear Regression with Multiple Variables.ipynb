    "***คือการทำให้ Gradient Descent วิ่งเข้าหาจุด Local Minimum ได้ไวมากขึ้น***\n",
    "\n",
    "We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is because θ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.\n",
    "\n",

    "or\n",

    "\n",
    "These aren't exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two techniques to help with this are **feature scaling** and **mean normalization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature scaling** involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean normalization** involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. \n",

    "$$x_i := \\dfrac{x_i - \\mu_i}{s_i}$$\n",
